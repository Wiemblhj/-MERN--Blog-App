            OpenAI inks deal with Axel Springer on licensing news for model
            training
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many, if not most, generative AI tech vendors argue that fair use
            entitles them to train AI models on copyrighted material scraped
            from the internet — even if they don’t get permission from the
            rightsholders. But some vendors, such as OpenAI, are hedging their
            bets — perhaps wary of the outcome of pending relevant lawsuits.
